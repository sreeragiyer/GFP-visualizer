### Global Food Prices Dashboard

This project demos a dashboard built on data from the [Global Food Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/lasaljaywardena/global-food-prices-starter/data) dataset and [Cost of Healthy Diet](https://ourworldindata.org/food-prices ) dataset.

Some of the tasks this dashboard could help understand -

- which food products are the best selling and most profitable for a user's particular locality in their country, so that they can know what to produce more of. 
- seasonal trends of a particular food product in a particular country.
- countries with most varities of food products 
- most popular food products across the globe.
- percentage of population in a country that cannot afford a healthy diet.
